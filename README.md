# NetScan - A Network Scanner
NetScan is a Python-based network scanner that detects active (online) hosts within a network range. It automatically identifies local IP address and subnet mask, constructs the network, and pings all devices in parallel to identify which are online. This tool works across Windows, macOS, and Linux systems.
